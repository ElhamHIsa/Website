    <p>
    This first picture is a screenshot of a turtle that i created to encourage individuals to practice helping our planet, through recycling, etc. A trinket is written code that is used to draw live art or graphics. I wrote this piece using python in trinket.io. 
    <p>You can watch the trinket live at <a href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/0612ecf235">This Link</a> </p>

    <p>
    In this is an interative project that i wrote in javaScript using code.org. The idea of this project is to give the users the ability to see different type of shirts with different types of words on it.
