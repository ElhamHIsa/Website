    Hey there!! On this website you will learn about me, my academics, extracurricular activities, projects that I am proud to have created, and get a glimpse of my interests. I have a wild fascination with the idea of astronomy and i hope to drive such interest into fuel to discover what is the unknown. Technology is our future, and learning how to communicate and command such capable entities would most definately be my gate to descovering the UNKNOWN. Have fun!!!
